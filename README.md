# Hey, I'm Polo — Web Designer in the Making  
*Turning pixels into purpose, one line of code at a time.*

## About Me  
I’m a creative soul with a thing for clean design, smooth interactions, and websites that *don’t suck*. Whether it’s whipping up landing pages or tweaking WordPress themes, I’m all about crafting digital experiences that look good and feel right.  

Still junior? Sure. Still learning? Always. But I bring hunger, hustle, and an eye for detail.

## What I Do  
- **Design & Layouts** – Intuitive UI with a strong visual punch  
- **Frontend Basics** – HTML, CSS, JS + frameworks like Bootstrap & jQuery  
- **WordPress Tinkering** – Themes, plugins, and making WP bend to my will  

## Tech Stack  
`HTML5` • `CSS3` • `JavaScript` • `Bootstrap` • `jQuery` • `WordPress` • `PHP`

## Currently Cooking  
- Honing my JS & animation game  
- Learning how to make WordPress less of a pain  
- Building a sleek portfolio site from scratch
